# EMT

For those who don't want an entire web-based server management
The original scripts never really got maintained, and i have since rewritten several.
The idea is still simple managing of services.

## Getting Started

Put the script somewhere, make it executable, et voila

### Prerequisites

There are a few, like: the scripts have some expectations of where to find files

```
-> you created all the directories/configurations that need to be used.
-> your system is completely set up and running.
-> you know what you're doing
```

## Usage

Just run the script, and usage should be clear.

## TODO

- error-checking/logging
- code clean-up
- integrate scripts with each other
